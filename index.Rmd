# Useful infor for AAU Business School staff

This is a simple GitBook with a few useful links for AAU Business School staff - This site is only managed periodically, so links may not always be the most recent - please feel free to drop me a mail or teams message if you find something faulty.

```{r include=FALSE}
# automatically create a bib database for R packages
knitr::write_bib(c(
  .packages(), 'bookdown', 'knitr', 'rmarkdown'
), 'packages.bib')
