If you do use some of the code, and you’re in academia, it would be pretty cool to get a reference (we are measured according to the relevance of our research) and every little bit helps. The best option for me would be if you refer to my PhD: Smith, R.A.B. (2020). Essays on macroeconomic interactions of sectoral balance sheets. Aalborg Universitetsforlag. Aalborg Universitet. Det Samfundsvidenskabelige Fakultet. Ph.D.-Serien OR, you can get the bibtex reference here. 1.1.2 Supervision guide for AAU Economics students The supervision guide for AAU students is a collection of project based tools. The idea is that students should be able to browse the table of contents, and see if there is something that they need on the page. There is too much content for a complete read-through, so I would recommend picking and choosing based on your needs. 1.2 License Attribution-Non Commercial 4.0 International (CC BY-NC 4.0) This is a human-readable summary of (and not a substitute for) the license.
